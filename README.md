# Graph Vector Function Architecture (GVFA)

This repository contains the placeholder implementation for the paper **"Graph Vector Function Architecture"**. GVFA introduces a novel, learning-free approach for graph representation formation that leverages hyperdimensional computing and vector function algebra to achieve competitive performance with significantly lower computational overhead compared to traditional GNNs.

> **Note:** This repository is provided as a placeholder during the double-blind review process. The full implementation and additional resources (e.g. models, detailed experiment scripts) will be made publicly available upon paper acceptance.
